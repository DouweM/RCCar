Alfred: RCCar
=============
Alfred is the name of my High School Final Project, which I built together with [Diederik van Iersel](https://github.com/DWvanIersel). 

Alfred is, simply put, a robot car that can be controlled remotely using a smartphone.

The robot car is built using LEGOs, with a LEGO NXT brick running the [leJOS NXJ](http://lejos.sourceforge.net/) operating system as its brain. 
It can be controlled by using an Android phone like a steering wheel.

This project, dubbed __RCCar__, is the application running on the NXT brick. Its counterpart Android app, __RCRemote__, can be found [here](https://github.com/DouweM/RCRemote).
